Sends email to notify you if there are any updates for your WordPress site. Can notify about core, plugin and theme updates.

== Description ==

Monitors your WordPress installation for core, plugin and theme updates and emails you when they are available. This plugin is ideal if you don't login to your WordPress admin regularly or you support a client's website.

*Features*

- Set the interval of how often to check for updates; hourly, twice daily or daily.
- Sets WordPress to check for updates more often meaning you get to know about updates sooner.
- Get emailed about core, plugin and theme updates.
- Chose if you want to be notified about active only themes and plugins updates.
- Remove upgrade nag message to non-admin users.
- For advanced users there are a number of filters and actions you can use. More coming soon.

This script is based on the [WP Updates Notifier](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-updates-notifier/) plugin from Scott Cariss. Many thanks.

Compared with the original this script is heavily feature reduced 
and has another approach:
It is intended to run from system cron across all existing wordpress blogs
without the need to install a plugin into every individual blog.
